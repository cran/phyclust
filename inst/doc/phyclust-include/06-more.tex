Combining functions \code{ms()}, \code{seqgen()} and \code{phyclust()},
some functions automatically for simulations and bootstraps are being
developed that can be used to examine and test different models and evolution
conditions.
Gaps will be considered and involved in the models.
Semi-supervised clustering can be easily extended from
the core of \pkg{phyclust}.

My future goal is to provide efficient tools and educational utilities
for science researches in statistics ways.
Visualization for large dataset \citep{Pemberton2008, Conrad2006} can
be implemented in \proglang{R} and evolution models for microsatellite
dataset \citep{Rosenberg2002,Shringarpure2009} can be built by extending
\pkg{phyclust}'s core.
